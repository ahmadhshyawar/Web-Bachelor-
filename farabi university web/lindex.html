                <p>Al-Farabi Kazakh National University (Kazakh: Әл-Фараби атындағы Қазақ ұлттық университеті, romanized: Äl-Farabi
            atyndağy Qazaq Ūlttyq Universitety), also called KazGU or KazNU, is a university in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Named after the
            Eastern philosopher and scholar al-Farabi, it is one of the country's largest universities.
            
            KazNU is the oldest classical university of the Republic established by a Decree of the Kazakh Regional Committee (KRC)
            office dated November 13, 1933. One year after Kazakhstan's 1990 declaration of independence, the name was changed to
            Al-Farabi Kazakh State University. According to the QS World University Rankings 2021 KazNU takes 165th place in the
            rating of the best universities of the world.
            
            In 2001, the government classified it as a "national" university. More than 20,000 students, post-graduates and PhD
            students study at KazNU, and there are more than 2500 faculty members working at KazNU, including 400 doctors of
            science, professors and more than 800 candidates of science and associate professors. Like other universities founded
            under the Soviet system, it is highly centralized.
